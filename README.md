# Terra
Terra is a mapping app geared towards hikers, climbers, mountaineers.
It allows users to drop waypoints and draw routes on a 3D terrain map of the world.
Users can share their routes with the community and access routes left by others.

Create a user account to view or add waypoints and routes.
Use the searchbar on the right side of the page to find locations around the world.
Use the toolbar to select a waypoint or route tool and to toggle whether you'd like to view routes and waypoints added by the community or just your own.
Click on a route or waypoint to see the name and description associated with it.
